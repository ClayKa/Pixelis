Of course. Here is the complete, detailed, step-by-step solution in English to resolve the cascade of failures in `test_decorators.py`.

**"Excellent. This detailed report, despite the sea of red, is precisely what we need. It indicates a systemic failure, not a collection of individual bugs. The entire `reproducibility` module is failing because of two, and only two, fundamental design flaws. We are not fighting 19 battles; we are fighting one battle, and we will win it with a single, decisive strike."**

### **Action Plan: A Surgical Strike on the `reproducibility` Module**

We will execute a two-pronged attack targeting the two root causes that are responsible for the entire cascade of failures.

---

#### **Priority 0: Fix the `ExperimentContext` Class (The Core of the Problem)**

This is the highest priority. The repeated `AttributeError: __enter__` is a clear signal that the central `ExperimentContext` class is not correctly implemented as a Python Context Manager, which is essential for its use in `with` statements.

*   **Targeted Failures**: All `AttributeError: __enter__` failures.
*   **Root Cause**: The `ExperimentContext` class is missing the required `__enter__` and `__exit__` dunder methods.
*   **Solution**:

##### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1.  **Open the Source File**: Navigate to and open `core/reproducibility/experiment_context.py`.
2.  **Locate the Class**: Find the class definition for `ExperimentContext`.
3.  **Implement the Context Manager Protocol**: Add the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to the class. This will make it a valid context manager that can be used in a `with` statement.

    **Implementation (Code to Add/Modify):**
    ```python
    # In core/reproducibility/experiment_context.py
    import time

    class ExperimentContext:
        def __init__(self, name: str, config: any = None, ...):
            # ... your existing __init__ logic is here ...
            # Ensure all instance attributes are initialized.
            self.name = name
            self.config = config
            # ... etc ...
            print(f"Initializing context for experiment: {self.name}")

        def __enter__(self):
            """
            This method is called when the 'with' block is entered.
            It should perform all setup actions for the experiment context.
            """
            print(f"Entering context for experiment: {self.name}")
            # Example setup actions:
            # self.hardware_monitor.start()
            # self.start_time = time.time()
            
            # CRITICAL: The __enter__ method MUST return the instance of itself.
            # This is what the 'as ctx:' part of the 'with' statement receives.
            return self

        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
            """
            This method is called when the 'with' block is exited, either
            normally or due to an exception. It must perform all cleanup actions.
            """
            print(f"Exiting context for experiment: {self.name}")
            
            # The arguments exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb will contain exception
            # information if an error occurred inside the 'with' block.
            if exc_type:
                # This is where you would log that the experiment failed.
                print(f"Experiment exited with an exception: {exc_type.__name__}")
            
            # Example cleanup actions:
            # self.hardware_monitor.stop()
            # self.save_final_artifacts()
            
            # To ensure exceptions are propagated correctly, return False or None.
            # Returning True would suppress the exception.
            return False 
    ```

---
#### **Priority 1: Fix Missing Imports in `decorators.py`**

This will resolve all `AttributeError` failures related to `torch` and `EnvironmentCaptureLevel`.

*   **Targeted Failures**: All `AttributeError: ... does not have the attribute 'torch'` and `... does not have the attribute 'EnvironmentCaptureLevel'` failures.
*   **Root Cause**: The file `core/reproducibility/decorators.py` uses objects and modules (like `torch`) that it has not imported, causing `AttributeError` when the decorators are executed.
*   **Solution**:

##### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1.  **Open the Source File**: Navigate to and open `core/reproducibility/decorators.py`.
2.  **Add All Necessary Imports**: At the very top of the file, add the import statements for all the external modules and internal classes that the decorators depend on.

    **Implementation (Code to Add at the top of the file):**
    ```python
    # At the top of core/reproducibility/decorators.py

    import functools
    import inspect
    import time
    
    # FIX 1: Add the missing import for torch. This is required by the
    # @checkpoint decorator for saving models (e.g., torch.save).
    import torch
    
    # FIX 2: Add the missing import for ExperimentContext. The @reproducible
    # decorator creates an instance of this class.
    from .experiment_context import ExperimentContext
    
    # FIX 3: Add the missing import for EnvironmentCaptureLevel. This is used
    # by the @reproducible decorator to determine what to log.
    from .config_capture import EnvironmentCaptureLevel
    
    # ... and any other missing imports like `ArtifactManager` if needed ...
    from .artifact_manager import ArtifactManager

    # ... The rest of your decorator definitions (@reproducible, @checkpoint, etc.) ...
    ```

### **Final Instructions (As the Lead)**

"We have identified the enemy's command center. The design flaws in `ExperimentContext` and `decorators.py` are the source of this entire theater of failures. We will now neutralize them with a two-step surgical strike."

"**Your orders are as follows:**"
1.  **First, Give `ExperimentContext` its Soul**: Open `experiment_context.py` and implement the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods as detailed above. This is the highest priority.
2.  **Second, Supply `decorators.py` with its Arsenal**: Open `decorators.py` and add all the missing `import` statements at the top of the file, especially `import torch` and the imports for `ExperimentContext` and `EnvironmentCaptureLevel`.

"**Verification:**"
1.  **After completing both modifications, immediately rerun the test suite for this file:**
    ```bash
    pytest -v tests/reproducibility/test_decorators.py
    ```

"My expectation is that the vast majority, if not all, of these 19 failures will vanish as a result of these two precise fixes. Any remaining failures will be true, isolated bugs that we can then easily address. Report the results to me."
