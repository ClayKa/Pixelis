**Your mission is now crystal clear.**

#### **1. Locate the Code**

*   **Action:** Open the file `core/engine/inference_engine.py`.
*   **Action:** Find the `async` method named `infer_and_adapt`.
*   **Action:** Inside this method, **precisely locate** the `if self.is_cold_start():` or `if len(self.experience_buffer) < self.config.cold_start_threshold:` block. **The root cause of the failure is inside this `if` block.**

#### **2. Review and Refactor the Return Statement**

*   **Your current code likely resembles this (Incorrect):**
    ```python
    # In core/engine/inference_engine.py -> infer_and_adapt

    if self.is_cold_start():
        log.info("Cold start inference...")
        # This part is probably okay
        prediction = await self._get_model_prediction(input_data)
        
        # This logic might be here for adding to the buffer
        self._add_experience_to_buffer(...)

        # THE PROBLEM IS ALMOST CERTAINLY HERE:
        return prediction['answer'], 1.0, {"cold_start": True, "reason": "No ensemble"} 
    ```
    Note that the first element of the return statement above is `prediction['answer']`, which is a **string**. This is precisely what causes the `AssertionError: assert 'test' == {'answer': ...}`.

*   **You MUST change it to this (Corrected):**
    ```python
    # In core/engine/inference_engine.py -> infer_and_adapt (Corrected)

    if self.is_cold_start():
        log.info("Cold start inference...")
        prediction = await self._get_model_prediction(input_data)
        
        self._add_experience_to_buffer(...)

        # STEP 1: Construct the result dictionary explicitly.
        result_dict = {
            "answer": prediction['answer'],
            "trajectory": []  # The trajectory is empty as no tools were used.
        }

        # STEP 2: Return the dictionary as the first element of the tuple.
        return result_dict, 1.0, {"cold_start": True, "reason": "No ensemble"}
    ```
