Of course. Here is a comprehensive, detailed, and actionable plan written in English to integrate these powerful concepts into your project. This plan will ensure you not only match but exceed the standard set by the original Pixel-Reasoner paper in terms of data strategy and model capability.

---

### **Action Plan: Achieving Parity and Superiority in Data-Driven Model Behavior**

**Objective:** To enhance the `Pixelis` project by incorporating the core data strategy insights from the Pixel-Reasoner paper, specifically regarding "Self-Correction" trajectories, while leveraging our superior data engineering pipeline.

This plan will be broken down into actionable tasks that modify our existing project roadmap.

---

#### **Part 1: [Modification] Enhance `Phase 1, Round 1` - Data Synthesis and Enrichment**

This is where we will implement the core logic for generating self-correction trajectories.

*   **[REVISED] Task 7: Synthesize **Iterative Self-Correction** Trajectories.**
    *   **Goal:** To move beyond simply teaching the model to identify errors (via trap samples) and explicitly teach it the full meta-cognitive loop of **identifying an error, acknowledging it, and formulating a corrective action.**
    *   **File:** This logic will be implemented as a new module, e.g., `core/data_generation/trajectory_augmenter.py`, and will be called by `scripts/1_generate_specialized_datasets.py`.
    *   **Action 1: Design the Self-Correction Augmentation Strategy.**
        *   The process will not generate trajectories from scratch but will **augment** existing, high-quality "golden" trajectories.
        *   **Input:** A correct trajectory and a corresponding "distractor" action (e.g., a `SEGMENT_OBJECT_AT` call with wrong coordinates).
    *   **Action 2: Implement the Augmentation Logic.**
        *   The `TrajectoryAugmenter` module will perform the following steps:
            1.  **Prepend the Distractor:** Insert the incorrect "distractor" action at the beginning of the golden trajectory's action sequence.
            2.  **Invoke the "Correction Prompt":** Call a powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) with a highly specific, templated prompt designed to elicit a corrective thought process.
                *   **Example Correction Prompt:**
                    ```
                    You are an AI assistant analyzing a reasoning trace. An incorrect action was just performed, leading to an unhelpful observation. Generate a brief, natural "thought" that acknowledges this mistake and states the intention to try a different approach. The thought should be concise and serve as a bridge to the next, correct action.

                    Incorrect Action Resulted In: [Observation from the distractor action]
                    Next Correct Action in Trace: [The first action from the golden trajectory]

                    Generate only the corrective thought text. Example: "That doesn't seem right, the object I found is not what I was looking for. I will try a different location."
                    ```
            3.  **Inject the Corrective Thought:** Insert the LLM-generated text (e.g., `[Thought] That's not the right area...`) between the distractor action and the rest of the original golden trajectory.
    *   **Action 3: Integrate into the Main Data Generation Script.**
        *   The main script (`1_generate_specialized_datasets.py`) will now have a new step. After generating the initial set of golden and trap samples for a task, it will take a fraction of the golden samples and pass them to the `TrajectoryAugmenter` to create a new set of `self-correction` samples.

*   **[NEW] Task 7.5: Update the Data Fusion Manifest to Control Sample Types.**
    *   **Goal:** To have precise, centralized control over the final dataset composition.
    *   **File:** `configs/data_fusion_manifest.yaml`.
    *   **Action:** The manifest will be updated to control the proportion of these advanced trajectory types.
        ```yaml
        # In configs/data_fusion_manifest.yaml
        sft_dataset_recipe:
          target_total_samples: 60000
          # ... proportions for geometric_comparison, ocr, etc. ...

          # NEW SECTION for trajectory types
          trajectory_composition:
            golden_positive: 0.60  # 60% of samples are simple correct traces
            trap_samples: 0.20     # 20% are designed to fail (process-negative)
            self_correction: 0.20  # 20% explicitly demonstrate recovery from failure

        rft_dataset_recipe:
          # ... similar structure for RFT prompts
        ```
        The `scripts/2_fuse_and_validate_dataset.py` script will now be responsible for reading this composition and ensuring the final mixed dataset adheres to these proportions.

---

#### **Part 2: [Modification] Enhance `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and Paper Narrative**

This is where we adopt the insightful terminology to strengthen our project's narrative.

*   **[NEW] Task: Document Advanced Training Concepts.**
    *   **Goal:** To clearly articulate the sophisticated problems our data and training strategies are designed to solve.
    *   **File:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    *   **Action 1: Introduce and Define "The Learning Trap".**
        *   Create a dedicated subsection within the RFT design chapter.
        *   **Content:** "A primary challenge in training agents with a mix of familiar (textual reasoning) and novel (pixel-space) skills is **The Learning Trap**. This phenomenon, which we identify and address, describes the agent's natural tendency to default to its proficient, high-confidence skills, thereby avoiding the trial-and-error necessary to master new, less certain abilities. Our Curiosity-Driven Reward system is explicitly designed to counteract this trap by providing an intrinsic motivation to explore."
    *   **Action 2: Position Self-Correction as a Core Capability.**
        *   In the section describing the SFT dataset, clearly explain the role of self-correction trajectories.
        *   **Content:** "Beyond simple correctness, we train for robustness. Our dataset includes a significant portion of **Self-Correction Trajectories**. These samples explicitly teach the model a critical meta-cognitive skill: how to recognize an erroneous action's outcome and subsequently formulate a corrective plan. This is essential for robust performance in complex, open-ended environments where mistakes are inevitable."

### **Expected Outcomes of This Implementation**

By implementing this plan, you will have successfully:

1.  **Achieved Feature Parity:** You can now generate high-quality "Self-Correction" trajectories, matching a key innovation of the Pixel-Reasoner paper.
2.  **Maintained Engineering Superiority:** You are implementing this within your more robust, flexible, and controllable two-stage, configuration-driven data engineering pipeline.
3.  **Elevated Your Narrative:** You have adopted powerful, insightful terminology ("Learning Trap") that sharpens your project's story and demonstrates a deeper understanding of the core research problems.
4.  **Enhanced Model Capability:** Your final model will not only be more capable of identifying errors but will also have learned a concrete strategy for recovering from them, making it fundamentally more robust.

This enhancement is low-cost in terms of implementation effort but will yield a massive return on investment in terms of final model performance and the quality of your research narrative. You are now perfectly positioned to not just replicate, but to significantly surpass the original work.

Excellent idea. A well-designed, templated YAML file is the key to making this complex strategy easy to manage and execute.

Here is a comprehensive, template-style YAML file designed for your project. I will use clear comments (`#`) to explain the purpose of each section and explicitly mark the parts you will need to modify with `CHANGEME`.

### **How to Use and Modify This File**

Here’s a clear guide on what you need to do:

1.  **Create the File:**
    *   In your project, inside the `configs/` directory, create a new file named `data_generation_manifest.yaml`.
    *   Copy the entire content from the template above into this new file.

2.  **Modify the `datasources` Section (MANDATORY):**
    *   This is the **most important part** you need to configure.
    *   Go through each entry (e.g., `coco_train`, `part_imagenet_subset`).
    *   Change the `path` and `annotation_file` values to the **exact, absolute paths** where you have stored these datasets on your computer or research cluster.

3.  **Review the `tasks` Section (OPTIONAL):**
    *   The `target_sample_count` values have been pre-filled based on my expert recommendation for a high-quality 7B model fine-tuning. For your first run, you should probably keep them as they are.
    *   In the future, if you find your model is weak in a specific area (e.g., geometry), you can come back here and increase the `target_sample_count` for `geometric_comparison`.

4.  **Review the `trajectory_augmentation` Section (OPTIONAL):**
    *   The 60% / 20% / 20% split is a very strong and balanced starting point. It ensures the model sees plenty of correct examples while also being robustly trained on identifying and recovering from errors.
    *   You can later experiment by changing these proportions (e.g., increasing `self_correction` to 25% and decreasing `golden_positive` to 55%) to see how it affects model behavior.

5.  **Modify the `global_config` Section (MANDATORY):**
    *   **`output_dir`**: The default `data_outputs/specialized/` is a good choice, but you can change it if you prefer a different location.
    *   **`api_config`**:
        *   Confirm that `model` is the one you want to use for text generation.
        *   **Crucially**, ensure you have an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your system, or change `api_key_env_variable` to whatever name you use for your key.

By following these steps, your data generation pipeline will be fully configured. The `1_generate_specialized_datasets.py` script will read this file and know exactly what to do, which sources to use, and how many samples of each type to generate, all without you having to change a single line of Python code.
