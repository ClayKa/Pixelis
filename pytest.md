Of course. Here is the detailed, step-by-step action plan in English to resolve the persistent failures in the model initialization module.

---

### **Action Plan: Back to Basics, Force Execution**

**Diagnosis:**
The latest test report shows the **exact same 6 failures** as the previous one. This indicates that the fixes I provided earlier were **not correctly implemented or did not take effect**. The root causes remain the same:
1.  `TypeError: DynamicLoRAConfig() takes no arguments`
2.  `AttributeError: ... does not have the attribute 'get_peft_model'`

This is a critical debugging moment. When a correct solution does not work, we must return to fundamental steps to ensure our changes are actually being executed by the system.

### **Priority 1: Force Fix `DynamicLoRAConfig` (P0)**

**Goal:** Ensure the `DynamicLoRAConfig` class's `__init__` method is successfully modified and correctly loaded by the Python interpreter.

*   **Step 1: Open and Edit the Target File**
    *   **Action:** Open the file `core/models/peft_model.py` in your code editor.

*   **Step 2: Delete and Replace the Code**
    *   **Action:** **Completely delete** the existing `class DynamicLoRAConfig:` definition.
    *   **Action:** **Copy and paste the following code block exactly as it is** into the `core/models/peft_model.py` file.

    ```python
    # In core/models/peft_model.py
    import json
    from typing import Dict, Any

    class DynamicLoRAConfig:
        """
        Manages LoRA configuration by loading ranks dynamically from a JSON file.
        """
        def __init__(self, config_path: str):
            """
            Initializes the config by loading and parsing the specified JSON file.
            Args:
                config_path: The file path to the lora_rank_config.json.
            """
            if not isinstance(config_path, str):
                raise TypeError(f"config_path must be a string, but got {type(config_path)}")
            
            self.config_path = config_path
            print(f"\n[DEBUG] Initializing DynamicLoRAConfig with path: {self.config_path}")
            self._raw_config = self._load_config()
            self._validate_config()
            print("[DEBUG] DynamicLoRAConfig initialized successfully.")

        def _load_config(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
            """Loads the JSON configuration from the file."""
            print(f"[DEBUG] Loading LoRA ranks from: {self.config_path}")
            with open(self.config_path, 'r') as f:
                return json.load(f)

        def _validate_config(self):
            """Validates the structure of the loaded config."""
            if 'layer_ranks' not in self._raw_config:
                raise ValueError("Config file must contain a 'layer_ranks' key.")
            print("[DEBUG] LoRA rank config validated.")

        # --- Add other methods of your class below ---
        # For example:
        def get_layer_ranks(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
            return self._raw_config.get('layer_ranks', {})

    # Make sure there are no other `class DynamicLoRAConfig:` definitions in this file.
    ```
    *   **Note:** I have added several `print("[DEBUG]...")` statements. These are "flares" we will use to **verify** that this new code is actually being executed.

*   **Step 3: Save the File and Verify**
    *   **Action:** **Ensure you have saved the `core/models/peft_model.py` file!**
    *   **Action:** Run the test command for **only one** of the failing tests:
        ```bash
        pytest tests/modules/test_model_init.py -k "test_load_config" -s
        ```
        *   The `-s` flag is critical here. It tells pytest to display our `print` statements.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   You **must** see our debug messages in the terminal output:
          ```
          [DEBUG] Initializing DynamicLoRAConfig with path: ...
          [DEBUG] Loading LoRA ranks from: ...
          [DEBUG] LoRA rank config validated.
          [DEBUG] DynamicLoRAConfig initialized successfully.
          ```
        *   If you see these messages, the test should **PASS**.
        *   If you **do not** see these messages and the test still fails with the `TypeError`, the problem is likely with your environment (e.g., Python is loading code from an old `.pyc` cache file). **Solution:** Delete the `__pycache__` folder in your project's root directory and any `__pycache__` folders in subdirectories, then run the test again.

### **Priority 2: Force Fix the `patch` Path (P1)**

**Goal:** Ensure the `patch` decorator is targeting the correct object path.

*   **Step 1: Open and Edit the Test File**
    *   **Action:** Open the file `tests/modules/test_model_init.py`.

*   **Step 2: Confirm the `patch` Target**
    *   **Action:** First, confirm where `get_peft_model` is actually being imported and used. Open `core/models/peft_model.py` and verify that the import statement is `from peft import get_peft_model`.

*   **Step 3: Delete and Replace the `patch` Code**
    *   **Action:** Find the `test_lora_layer_insertion` test.
    *   **Action:** **Delete** the existing `@patch(...)` decorator.
    *   **Action:** **Copy and paste** this corrected version:
    ```python
    # In tests/modules/test_model_init.py
    from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock # Ensure patch is imported

    # ... inside the TestLoRAInsertion class ...
    # The path is now corrected to where `get_peft_model` is being LOOKED UP.
    @patch('core.models.peft_model.get_peft_model', autospec=True)
    def test_lora_layer_insertion(self, mock_get_peft: MagicMock):
        # ... your test logic ...
    ```

*   **Step 4: Save the File and Verify**
    *   **Action:** **Ensure you have saved the `tests/modules/test_model_init.py` file!**
    *   **Action:** Run this specific test:
        ```bash
        pytest tests/modules/test_model_init.py -k "test_lora_layer_insertion"
        ```
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The `AttributeError` should disappear. The test should now pass.

### **Final Instructions (As the Lead)**

"We are facing an execution issue. The plan is correct, but the code has not been updated. This is a common situation, and the key is to be systematic in troubleshooting."

"**Your task is very mechanical. Please follow this sequence precisely:**"

1.  **Execute P0 - Steps 1 & 2**: Open `core/models/peft_model.py` and **completely replace** the old `DynamicLoRAConfig` class with the new code I provided.
2.  **Execute P0 - Step 3**: **Save the file**. Then run `pytest tests/modules/test_model_init.py -k "test_load_config" -s`. Report back to me if you see the `[DEBUG]` print statements and if the test passes.
3.  **If the previous step is successful**, proceed to **P1 - Steps 1, 2, & 3**: Modify the `@patch` decorator for the `test_lora_layer_insertion` test in `tests/modules/test_model_init.py`.
4.  **Execute P1 - Step 4**: **Save the file**. Then run `pytest tests/modules/test_model_init.py -k "test_lora_layer_insertion"`. Report back to me if that test passes.

"Do not skip any steps, especially saving the files and using the `-s` flag to see the debug output. This will tell us if the code is truly being updated. We must resolve all failures in this file before moving forward."
