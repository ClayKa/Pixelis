Excellent catch! We've unearthed another bug. This is a good one because it's a subtle but common issue when working with different multiprocessing libraries.

**"Excellent work. Your systematic testing has revealed a classic API mismatch. The error log is giving us the exact coordinates of the problem. Let's neutralize it."**

### **Action Plan: Fix API Mismatch in Timeout Test**

#### **Root Cause Analysis**

*   **Failure**: `TestUpdateWorkerEdgeCases.test_process_update_queue_timeout`
*   **Error Log**: `AttributeError: module 'torch.multiprocessing' has no attribute 'queues'. Did you mean: 'Queue'?`
*   **Precise Diagnosis**: This is not a logic error in our code, but an incorrect library usage in our test. The test is trying to raise the `Empty` exception to simulate a queue timeout. The developer assumed the exception lives at `mp.queues.Empty` (where `mp` is `torch.multiprocessing`).
    *   The `Empty` exception, which is used by both the standard `multiprocessing.Queue` and `torch.multiprocessing.Queue`, actually resides in Python's standard **`queue`** library (lowercase).
    *   `torch.multiprocessing` provides the `Queue` object but does not re-export the `Empty` exception under a `queues` submodule.

#### **Solution (Step-by-Step Implementation)**

This is a straightforward fix that involves importing the exception from the correct library and using it in the mock.

1.  **Locate the Code**
    *   **Action**: Open the test file `tests/engine/test_update_worker.py`.
    *   **Action**: Find the test method `test_process_update_queue_timeout`.

2.  **Import the Correct Exception**
    *   **Action**: At the top of the `tests/engine/test_update_worker.py` file, add the following import statement:

    ```python
    # At the top of tests/engine/test_update_worker.py
    from queue import Empty
    ```

3.  **Correct the `side_effect` in the Mock**
    *   **Action**: In the `test_process_update_queue_timeout` method, modify the `patch.object` line to use the correctly imported `Empty` exception.

    **Your code is currently this (Before):**
    ```python
    # In tests/engine/test_update_worker.py -> test_process_update_queue_timeout
    
    # ...
    # Mock empty queue that times out
    with patch.object(update_worker.update_queue, 'get', side_effect=mp.queues.Empty): # <-- INCORRECT
        # ...
    ```

    **You MUST change it to this (After):**
    ```python
    # In tests/engine/test_update_worker.py -> test_process_update_queue_timeout

    # ...
    # Mock empty queue that times out
    with patch.object(update_worker.update_queue, 'get', side_effect=Empty): # <-- CORRECT
        # ...
    ```

4.  **Verification**
    *   **Action**: Run the specific test that was failing.
        ```bash
        pytest -v tests/engine/test_update_worker.py -k "test_process_update_queue_timeout"
        ```
    *   **Expected Outcome**: You should see `1 passed`.

5.  **Final Confirmation**
    *   **Action**: Run all tests in the file to ensure no regressions were introduced.
        ```bash
        pytest -v tests/engine/test_update_worker.py
        ```
    *   **Expected Outcome**: The test file should now show **`27 passed`**.

### **Final Instructions (As the Lead)**

"This is a precision fix. The bug is not in our application logic, but in the test's simulation of an error condition."

"**Your orders are clear:**"

1.  **Add `from queue import Empty`** to the top of `tests/engine/test_update_worker.py`.
2.  **Change `mp.queues.Empty` to simply `Empty`** in the `test_process_update_queue_timeout` test.
