# Phase 3 Round 3 Summary: Human Evaluation of Reasoning Quality

## Overview
Phase 3 Round 3 establishes a comprehensive framework for human evaluation of reasoning trajectory quality, moving beyond simple accuracy metrics to assess the coherence, efficiency, and perceived intelligence of model reasoning processes.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 001: Define the Evaluation Scope and Hypotheses ✅
**File Created**: `docs/HUMAN_EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md`

**Key Achievements**:
- Defined three testable hypotheses:
  - **H1 (Coherence)**: Models with R_coherence produce more logical trajectories
  - **H2 (Efficiency)**: Online models show more intelligent exploration
  - **H3 (Curiosity)**: Curiosity rewards enable thorough but purposeful exploration
- Established 4-dimensional evaluation criteria:
  - Correctness (binary sanity check)
  - Coherence & Logicality (1-5 scale)
  - Efficiency & Intelligence (1-5 scale)
  - Thoroughness (1-5 scale)
- Specified 7 models for comparison across baseline, ablation, and full configurations
- Designed statistical analysis plan with Wilcoxon tests and effect size calculations

### Task 002: Design the Human Evaluation Interface and Protocol ✅

- Special case handling instructions
- Quality check procedures

**Data Preparation Pipeline**:
- **Sampling Strategy**:

  - Shuffle order per annotator
- **Mock Data Generation**:
  - Testing capability with synthetic trajectories
  - Configurable for different experimental setups

### Task 004: Analyze Results and Report Inter-Annotator Agreement ✅
**File Created**: `scripts/analyze_human_eval_results.py`

**Analysis Capabilities**:
- **Inter-Annotator Agreement**:
  - Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for ordinal data
  - Fleiss' Kappa for categorical agreement
  - Pairwise Cohen's Kappa with linear weighting
  - Complete agreement percentages
- **Statistical Testing**:
  - Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired comparisons
  - Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples
  - Effect size calculations (Cohen's d, rank-biserial correlation)
  - Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
- **Disagreement Resolution**:
  - Automatic identification of high-variance cases (σ > 1.5)
  - Expert adjudication workflow
  - Documented resolution protocol
- **Visualization Suite**:
  - Model comparison box plots
  - Agreement metric charts
  - Preference distributions
  - Correlation matrices
  - Time analysis histograms

**Report Generation**:
- Multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, TXT)
- Executive summary with key findings
- Hypothesis test results with p-values
- Model performance rankings
- Annotator statistics

## Budget Impact
**Added to COMPUTE_BUDGET.md**:
- Total annotations required: 900 (300 samples × 3 annotators)
- Annotation time: ~37.5 hours
- Total with training/breaks: ~53 hours
- Estimated cost: ~$1,900
  - Primary annotation: $1,650
  - Expert adjudication: $150
  - Platform/tools: $100

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Blind Evaluation Design
- **Rationale**: Eliminates bias from model reputation
- **Implementation**: Random assignment with tracking for later unblinding

### 2. Multi-Metric Assessment
- **Rationale**: Captures different aspects of reasoning quality
- **Trade-off**: Longer annotation time but richer insights

### 3. Statistical Rigor
- **Rationale**: Publication-quality results require proper statistics
- **Implementation**: Multiple agreement metrics and hypothesis tests

### 4. Disagreement Resolution
- **Rationale**: High-variance cases need expert review
- **Protocol**: Threshold-based flagging with adjudication workflow

## Integration Points

### With Phase 3 Round 1 (Ablation Studies)
- Evaluation data comes from model trajectories generated during ablation experiments
- Results feed back into model selection decisions

### With Phase 3 Round 2 (Robustness Testing)
- Human ratings can validate automated robustness metrics
- Provides qualitative insights into failure modes

### With Future Development
- Framework is extensible for new metrics or models
- Can be adapted for other reasoning evaluation tasks

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Viable Results
- Inter-annotator agreement κ > 0.4 (fair agreement)
- At least one hypothesis confirmed (p < 0.05)
- Clear model ranking on at least one dimension

### Target Outcomes
- κ > 0.6 (substantial agreement)
- All primary hypotheses tested
- Clear evidence of reasoning improvements
- Actionable insights for future development

## Lessons Learned

### Technical
- Gradio provides excellent rapid prototyping for annotation interfaces
- Proper randomization is crucial for unbiased evaluation
- Statistical power requires careful sample size planning

### Process
- Annotator training is critical for consistency
- Disagreement resolution needs to be planned upfront
- Time estimates should include breaks and quality checks

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Generate actual model trajectories for evaluation
2. Recruit and train annotators
3. Conduct pilot study to refine guidelines
4. Begin main annotation campaign

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate with automated quality metrics
- Develop real-time agreement monitoring
- Create annotator performance dashboards
- Build consensus prediction models
