# Phase 2 Round 3: Core Inference and Gated Learning Mechanisms - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented the core inference and gated learning mechanisms for the TTRL online learning system. This includes temporal ensemble voting with full provenance tracking, confidence-based gating, adaptive learning rate strategies, and a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) safety valve for initial deployment.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 001: Implement the Temporal Ensemble Logic ✅
**What was done:**
- Enhanced the `infer_and_adapt()` function in inference_engine.py
- Orchestrated the complete inference sequence:
  1. Get initial model prediction
  2. Retrieve k-NN neighbors from experience buffer
  3. Apply temporal ensemble voting
  4. Trigger learning updates based on confidence

**Key implementation:**
```python
async def infer_and_adapt(self, input_data):
    initial_prediction = await self._get_model_prediction(input_data)
    neighbors = self.experience_buffer.search_index(input_data, k=5)
    voting_result = self.voting_module.vote(initial_prediction, neighbors)
    if self._should_trigger_update(voting_result.confidence):
        await self._enqueue_update_task(...)
```

### Task 002: Implement Configurable Voting Strategies ✅
**What was done:**
- Enhanced VotingResult dataclass with comprehensive provenance tracking
- Modified all voting strategies to return detailed audit trails
- Implemented provenance fields:
  - `model_self_answer`: The model's initial prediction
  - `retrieved_neighbors_count`: Number of neighbors retrieved
  - `neighbor_answers`: List of neighbor predictions with confidence
  - `voting_strategy`: Strategy used for consensus

**Voting Strategies Implemented:**
1. **Majority Voting**: Simple vote counting
2. **Weighted Voting**: Confidence and similarity-weighted consensus
3. **Confidence Voting**: Only considers high-confidence votes
4. **Ensemble Voting**: Combines multiple strategies

**Key features:**
- Complete audit trail for every decision
- Vote distribution tracking
- Consensus strength calculation
- Agreement factor for confidence adjustment

### Task 003: Implement the Confidence Gating Mechanism ✅
**What was done:**
- Implemented confidence threshold checking before triggering updates
- Added detailed logging for gate pass/fail decisions
- Ensures system only learns from high-quality pseudo-labels

**Implementation:**
```python
def _should_trigger_update(self, confidence: float) -> bool:
    should_update = confidence >= self.confidence_threshold
    if should_update:
        logger.debug(f"Confidence gate PASSED: {confidence:.3f} >= {threshold:.3f}")
    else:
        logger.debug(f"Confidence gate FAILED: {confidence:.3f} < {threshold:.3f}")
    return should_update
```

### Task 004: Implement Proportional and Bounded Learning Rate Strategy ✅
**What was done:**
- Replaced discrete dual-mode with continuous adaptive learning rate
- Learning rate proportional to error (1 - confidence)
- Bounded within [min_lr, max_lr] for stability
- Higher confidence → lower LR (conservative updates)
- Lower confidence → higher LR (larger corrections)

**Formula:**
```python
error = 1.0 - confidence
lr_proportional = max_lr * error
lr_bounded = np.clip(lr_proportional, min_lr, max_lr)
```

### Task 005: Implement Human-in-the-Loop Safety Valve ✅
**What was done:**
- Added HIL mode configuration to inference engine
- Implemented sampling strategy (default 2% of updates)
- Created Gradio-based human review interface
- Supports approve/reject decisions with notes
- Tracks review statistics and approval rates

**HIL Components:**
1. **Sampling Logic**: Randomly samples configured percentage for review
2. **Review Queue**: Separate queue for human review tasks
3. **Web Interface**: Interactive Gradio app for reviewers
4. **Decision Processing**: Routes approved tasks to update queue

**Files created:**
- `scripts/human_review_app.py`: Complete Gradio interface with:
  - Task display with trajectory and provenance
  - Approve/Reject controls with reviewer notes
  - Real-time statistics tracking
  - Auto-load next task functionality

## Configuration Updates ✅
Enhanced `core/config_schema.py` with HIL settings:
```python
# Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) configuration
hil_mode_enabled: bool = False
hil_review_percentage: float = 0.02  # 2% sampling
hil_interface_host: str = "127.0.0.1"
hil_interface_port: int = 7860
hil_auto_approve_timeout: Optional[int] = None
```

## Comprehensive Testing ✅
Created extensive test suites covering all functionality:

### Test Coverage:
1. **Voting Module Tests** (`tests/modules/test_voting.py`):
   - All voting strategies (majority, weighted, confidence, ensemble)
   - Provenance tracking validation
   - Vote weight calculation

   - Edge cases (insufficient votes, missing data)

2. **Inference Engine Tests** (`tests/engine/test_inference_engine.py`):
   - Confidence gating mechanism
   - Adaptive learning rate calculation
