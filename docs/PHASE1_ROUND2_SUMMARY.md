### Difficulty Scoring System (`scripts/preprocess_data.py`)

**Multi-Factor Scoring Components:**
```python
SCORING_WEIGHTS = {
    "trajectory_complexity": 0.30,    # Length and structure
    "operation_sophistication": 0.25, # Visual operation complexity
    "reasoning_depth": 0.20,         # Reasoning vs action ratio
    "error_patterns": 0.15,          # Self-corrections/repetitions
    "task_type": 0.10                # Inherent task difficulty
}
```

**Operation Complexity Hierarchy:**
```python
OPERATION_COMPLEXITY = {
    "TRACK_OBJECT": 3.0,       # Most complex (temporal)
    "SEGMENT_OBJECT_AT": 3.0,  # Complex spatial reasoning
    "GET_PROPERTIES": 2.0,     # Medium complexity
    "ZOOM_IN": 2.0,           # Medium complexity
    "READ_TEXT": 1.0,         # Simple operation
    "THINK": 0.5              # Basic reasoning
}
```

## Curriculum Configuration

### Progression Stages
```yaml
Stage 1 (0-2k steps):
  simple: 100%, medium: 0%, hard: 0%
  
Stage 2 (2k-4k steps):
  simple: 70%, medium: 30%, hard: 0%
  
Stage 3 (4k-6k steps):
  simple: 40%, medium: 40%, hard: 20%
  
Stage 4 (6k-8k steps):
  simple: 20%, medium: 40%, hard: 40%
  
Stage 5 (8k+ steps):
  simple: 20%, medium: 30%, hard: 50%
```

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Rollback Threshold**: -0.05 (5% performance drop)
- **Minimum Performance**: 0.6 (60% for advancement)
- **Cooldown Period**: 1000 steps after rollback
- **Interval Scaling**: 2x after each rollback

```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Percentile-based categorization** ensures balanced distribution
2. **Multi-factor scoring** captures complexity better than single metrics
3. **Immediate re-evaluation** provides accurate advancement decisions
4. **Cooldown periods** prevent oscillation between stages

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Memory constraints** → Gradient checkpointing + LoRA
2. **Unstable progression** → Performance windows + rollback
3. **Data imbalance** → Percentile-based splitting
4. **Testing complexity** → Modular design with unit tests

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 Round 3)
1. Generate full-scale CoTA dataset (100K+ samples)
2. Run complete SFT training with real data
3. Evaluate on downstream benchmarks
4. Fine-tune curriculum thresholds based on results

### Future Enhancements
1. **Multi-GPU Support**: Implement FSDP for distributed training
2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Real-time difficulty adjustment
3. **Competence Metrics**: Track per-skill mastery
4. **Active Learning**: Select challenging samples dynamically

## Conclusion

Phase 1 Round 2 delivered a sophisticated, production-ready SFT implementation with curriculum learning that:

- **Intelligently manages difficulty progression** through multi-factor scoring
- **Ensures training stability** with automatic rollback mechanisms
- **Optimizes resource usage** through gradient checkpointing and LoRA
