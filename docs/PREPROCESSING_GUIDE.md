# CoTA Data Preprocessing Guide

## Overview

The preprocessing system calculates composite difficulty scores for Chain-of-Thought-Action (CoTA) training samples, enabling effective curriculum learning for vision-language models. This guide explains the difficulty scoring methodology, usage, and configuration options.

## Difficulty Scoring Framework

### Composite Score Components

The difficulty score is a weighted combination of five key factors:

1. **Trajectory Complexity (30% weight)**
   - Measures the length and structural complexity of reasoning trajectories
   - Uses log-scaling to handle outliers: `log(length + 1) / log(max_length + 1)`
   - Longer trajectories indicate more complex reasoning requirements

2. **Operation Sophistication (25% weight)**
   - Evaluates the complexity of visual operations used
   - Operations have different complexity scores:
     - `TRACK_OBJECT`, `SEGMENT_OBJECT_AT`: 3.0 (most complex)
     - `GET_PROPERTIES`, `ZOOM_IN`: 2.0 (medium complexity)
     - `READ_TEXT`: 1.0 (simple)
   - Diversity bonus for using varied operations

3. **Reasoning Depth (20% weight)**
   - Analyzes the ratio of thinking steps to action steps
   - Optimal ratio: 20-60% thinking steps
   - Penalizes both too few (insufficient reasoning) and too many (confusion)

4. **Error Patterns (15% weight)**
   - Detects self-corrections, repetitions, and backtracking
   - Self-correction: +0.3 difficulty
   - Repetitive actions (3+ same operations): +0.2 difficulty
   - Backtracking to previous coordinates: +0.2 difficulty

5. **Task Type Difficulty (10% weight)**
   - Inherent difficulty of different task types:
     - Temporal tracking: 1.0 (hardest)
     - Geometric comparison: 0.8
     - Spatial reasoning: 0.7
     - Object counting: 0.4
     - Text extraction: 0.3 (simplest)

### Categorization Strategy

Samples are categorized using **percentile-based thresholds** for balanced distribution:

- **Simple**: 0-33rd percentile of scores
- **Medium**: 33rd-66th percentile
- **Hard**: 66th-100th percentile

This ensures curriculum balance regardless of the actual score distribution.

## Usage

### Basic Preprocessing

```bash
# Preprocess CoTA data with default settings
python scripts/preprocess_data.py \
    --input data/raw/cota_dataset.json \
    --output data/processed/curriculum \
    --split-by-category
```

### With Custom Configuration

```bash
# Use custom configuration file
python scripts/preprocess_data.py \
    --input data/raw/cota_dataset.json \
    --output data/processed/curriculum \
    --config configs/preprocess_config.yaml \
    --statistics-report reports/preprocessing_stats.txt
```

### Command-Line Options

- `--input`: Path to raw CoTA data JSON file (required)
- `--output`: Output directory for processed data (default: `data/processed/curriculum`)
- `--config`: Custom configuration YAML file
- `--split-by-category`: Save separate files for each difficulty level (recommended)
- `--statistics-report`: Path for detailed statistics report

## Curriculum Learning Integration

### Using CurriculumDataset

```python
from scripts.preprocess_data import CurriculumDataset

# Initialize dataset
dataset = CurriculumDataset(
    data_dir="data/processed/curriculum",
    initial_difficulty="simple"
)

# Get batch for current training stage
batch = dataset.get_curriculum_batch(
    stage=2,        # Middle stage of training
    batch_size=32   # Number of samples
)
```

### Stage-Based Difficulty Mixtures

The system provides automatic curriculum progression:

- **Stage 0**: 80% simple, 20% medium, 0% hard
- **Stage 1**: 50% simple, 40% medium, 10% hard
- **Stage 2**: 30% simple, 50% medium, 20% hard
- **Stage 3**: 20% simple, 40% medium, 40% hard
- **Stage 4+**: 10% simple, 30% medium, 60% hard

## Edge Case Handling

The system robustly handles various edge cases:

1. **Very Short Trajectories** (< 2 steps)
   - Assigned minimum difficulty of 0.1
   - Ensures valid scoring even for trivial tasks

2. **Very Long Trajectories** (> 15 steps)
   - Log-scaled to prevent score explosion
   - Checked for repetitions - capped at 0.7 if highly repetitive

3. **Pure Reasoning Trajectories**
   - Trajectories with only THINK steps
   - Assigned base difficulty of 0.3

4. **Outlier Detection**
   - Uses Interquartile Range (IQR) method
   - Filters outliers before percentile calculation
   - Ensures robust categorization

5. **Trap Samples**
   - Automatic difficulty boost (+0.2) for trap samples
   - Higher sampling weight (1.5x) for hard negative mining

## Quality Validation

The preprocessor performs automatic validation:

### Distribution Balance
- Ensures minimum 25% samples per difficulty category
- Warns if any category is underrepresented

### Task Diversity
- Checks that each difficulty category contains at least 3 task types
- Ensures varied learning experiences

### Statistical Analysis
- Generates comprehensive statistics report
- Tracks score distributions, operation usage, trajectory lengths
- Provides actionable insights for training optimization

## Statistics Report

The system generates detailed statistics including:

- Difficulty score distribution (mean, std, min, max, quartiles)
- Category distribution and percentages
- Task type distribution by difficulty
- Sample type distribution
- Trajectory length statistics
- Operation usage frequency
- Configuration used

Example report location: `data/processed/statistics_report.txt`

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**
   - Ensure raw CoTA data has diverse task types
   - Include both positive and negative samples
   - Validate trajectory integrity before preprocessing

2. **Configuration Tuning**
   - Start with default weights and adjust based on model performance
   - Monitor validation accuracy to trigger curriculum advancement
   - Use statistics reports to identify data imbalances

3. **Curriculum Progression**
   - Begin with high simple:medium ratio (80:20)
   - Gradually increase difficulty based on model convergence
   - Use validation performance to trigger stage transitions

4. **Hard Sample Mining**
   - Leverage `sampling_weight` field for weighted sampling
   - Oversample trap and self-correction samples
   - Monitor model performance on different sample types

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Imbalanced Distribution
**Solution**: Check if input data has sufficient diversity. Adjust percentile thresholds if needed.

### Issue: All Samples Categorized as Same Difficulty
**Solution**: Verify trajectory diversity in input data. Check if difficulty weights sum to 1.0.

### Issue: Memory Error with Large Datasets
**Solution**: Process data in chunks. Use `--split-by-category` to save separate files.

### Issue: Inconsistent Categorization
**Solution**: Set fixed random seed with `--seed` parameter for reproducibility.

## Integration Example

```python
# In training script
from scripts.preprocess_data import CurriculumDataset

class CurriculumTrainer:
    def __init__(self, data_dir):
        self.dataset = CurriculumDataset(data_dir)
        self.current_stage = 0
        
    def should_advance_curriculum(self, val_accuracy):
        """Advance curriculum based on validation accuracy"""
        thresholds = [0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85]
        if self.current_stage < len(thresholds):
            if val_accuracy > thresholds[self.current_stage]:
                self.current_stage += 1
                print(f"Advancing to curriculum stage {self.current_stage}")
                return True
        return False
    
    def get_training_batch(self, batch_size):
        """Get batch for current curriculum stage"""
        return self.dataset.get_curriculum_batch(
            stage=self.current_stage,
            batch_size=batch_size
        )
```
