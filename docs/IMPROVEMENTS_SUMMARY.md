# Pixelis Codebase Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the Pixelis codebase to enhance reproducibility, training stability, and debuggability as outlined in `improvement.md`.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. ✅ **Enforced Full Determinism (Highest Priority)**

#### Files Created/Modified:
- **Created**: `core/utils/reproducibility.py` - Centralized reproducibility utility module
- **Modified**: `scripts/train.py`, `scripts/evaluate.py`, `scripts/analyze_lora_ranks.py`
- **Modified**: `scripts/train_rft.py`, `scripts/micro_benchmark.py`

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Global Seed Management**: `set_global_seed()` function sets seeds for Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and CUDA
- **Deterministic Mode**: `enable_deterministic_mode()` configures PyTorch and cuDNN for reproducible behavior
- **DataLoader Reproducibility**: `get_reproducible_dataloader_kwargs()` and `seed_worker()` ensure deterministic data loading
- **System Info Tracking**: `get_system_info()` captures environment details for reproducibility
- **Verification Utility**: `verify_determinism()` function to test reproducibility

#### Integration:
- All entry-point scripts now accept `--seed` and `--deterministic` command-line arguments
- Seeds and deterministic settings are propagated through configuration to all components
- System information is logged at startup for reproducibility tracking

### 2. ✅ **Hardened Curriculum Management System (High Priority)**

#### Files Modified:
- **Enhanced**: `scripts/train_sft.py` - CurriculumManager class
- **Modified**: `configs/training_params.yaml` - Added new curriculum parameters
- **Created**: `core/config_schema.py` - Added CurriculumConfig dataclass

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Metric History Tracking**: Maintains deques of metrics for smoothing
- **Smoothed Metric Calculation**: `_get_smoothed_metric()` computes moving averages
- **Patience-Based Advancement**: Requires sustained performance over multiple cycles
- **Cooldown Mechanism**: Prevents rapid curriculum changes after advancement/rollback
- **Exit Criteria Support**: Configurable per-stage metrics thresholds

#### Configuration Parameters Added:
```yaml
curriculum:
  smoothing_window_size: 3  # Number of metrics to average
  patience_cycles: 2         # Consecutive good evaluations before advancement
  cooldown_cycles: 3         # Evaluation cycles to wait after changes
```

### 3. ✅ **Enhanced Debuggability with Distributed Tracing**

#### Files Created/Modified:
- **Created**: `core/utils/context.py` - Context management for distributed tracing
- **Enhanced**: `core/utils/logging_utils.py` - Added TracingFormatter classes
- **Modified**: `core/engine/inference_engine.py` - Integrated trace ID generation

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **TraceContext Class**: Manages trace IDs and metadata across async operations
- **TracedOperation Context Manager**: Automatic trace lifecycle management
- **TracingFormatter**: Enriches logs with trace IDs and component information
- **ColoredTracingFormatter**: Combined tracing and colored output
- **Hierarchical Trace IDs**: Support for parent-child trace relationships

#### Log Format Enhancement:
```
# Standard format:
%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s

# With tracing enabled:
%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - [%(trace_id)s|%(component)s] - %(message)s
```

## Testing and Verification

### Test Script Created:
- `tests/test_improvements.py` - Comprehensive test suite for all improvements

## Usage Examples

### 1. Running Training with Full Reproducibility:
```bash
python scripts/train.py --mode sft --seed 42 --deterministic
```

### 2. Evaluation with Tracing:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --model model.pt --seed 42 --deterministic
```

### 3. Enabling Tracing in Code:
```python
from core.utils.logging_utils import setup_logging
from core.utils.context import TracedOperation

# Setup logging with tracing
setup_logging(use_tracing=True, use_colors=True)

# Use traced operations
with TracedOperation("my_operation", "MyComponent") as op:
    logger.info(f"Processing with trace {op.trace_id}")
    # Your code here
```

### 4. Using Enhanced Curriculum Management:
```python
from scripts.train_sft import CurriculumManager

config = {
    "curriculum": {
        "smoothing_window_size": 3,
        "patience_cycles": 2,
        "cooldown_cycles": 3,
        # ... other settings
    }
}

manager = CurriculumManager(config)
# Manager now uses smoothed metrics and patience-based advancement
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Reproducibility**
- Experiments are now fully reproducible with the same seed
- System information is tracked for environment reproducibility
- DataLoader randomness is controlled

### 2. **Training Stability**

- Cooldown periods prevent rapid oscillations
- Metric-based exit criteria provide fine-grained control

### 3. **Debuggability**
- Every request can be traced end-to-end with unique IDs
- Logs are enriched with trace context for easier debugging
- Component attribution helps identify issue sources

### 4. **Code Quality**
- Centralized utilities reduce code duplication
- Configuration is validated through dataclasses
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
