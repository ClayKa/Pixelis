**Implementation**:
- User inputs are held in memory only for request duration
- Automatic memory cleanup after response generation
- No disk-based caching of raw user data
- Temporary files are securely deleted immediately after use

#### 3.1.2 Learning from Anonymized Data Only
**Policy**: The system learns only from fully anonymized and redacted data.

**Implementation**:
- All text is processed through PII redaction before storage
- Images have EXIF metadata stripped
- Embeddings replace raw data where possible
- No reverse-engineering of original inputs is possible

### 3.2 PII Detection and Redaction

- URLs containing personal information
- Date of birth
- Medical record numbers
- Account numbers

**Redaction Method**:
```
Original: "My name is John Smith and my email is john@example.com"
Redacted: "My name is [PERSON] and my email is [EMAIL]"
```

#### 3.2.2 Image Data
**Automatic Processing**:
- Strip all EXIF metadata
- Remove GPS coordinates
- Clear camera/device information
- Eliminate timestamps from metadata
- Preserve only pixel data and dimensions

### 3.3 Experience Buffer Security
