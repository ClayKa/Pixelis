## Technical Specifications

### Difficulty Scoring Components
```python
WEIGHTS = {
    "trajectory_complexity": 0.30,
    "operation_sophistication": 0.25,
    "reasoning_depth": 0.20,
    "error_patterns": 0.15,
    "task_type": 0.10
}
```

### Curriculum Progression
```yaml
Stage 1 (0-2k steps):    100% simple
Stage 2 (2k-4k steps):   70% simple, 30% medium
Stage 3 (4k-6k steps):   40% simple, 40% medium, 20% hard
Stage 4 (6k-8k steps):   20% simple, 40% medium, 40% hard
Stage 5 (8k+ steps):     20% simple, 30% medium, 50% hard
```

### Rollback Mechanism
- **Trigger**: Performance drop > 5% or avg performance < 60%
- **Cooldown**: 1000 steps before retry
- **Interval Scaling**: 2x advancement interval after rollback

## Testing Results
