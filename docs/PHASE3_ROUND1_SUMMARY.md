## Overview
Phase 3 Round 1 establishes a rigorous experimental framework for conducting ablation studies that demonstrate the contribution of each component in the Pixelis architecture. This round focuses on creating systematic comparisons between different model configurations and establishing new benchmarks that showcase the unique capabilities of the system.

## Completed Tasks

  3. **RFT-Base**: RFT with task reward only
  4. **RFT-Full**: RFT with all reward components (task + curiosity + coherence)
  5. **Online**: Final model with TTRL evolution

**Key Files Created**:
- `configs/ablation/baseline.yaml`

| 50%            | 89.7%       | 1.79x             |
| 100%           | 94.2%       | 1.00x (baseline)  |

### Task 005: Execute and Analyze Ablation and Comparative Experiments ✅
**Objective**: Run comprehensive experiments and create results tables.

**Implementation**:
